# FrogHub DataCap Allocator - Client Applications

Welcome to the dedicated Froghub Tech DC Allocator channel. This repository serves as a public ledger for DataCap allocation requests and tracking, improving the transparency and efficiency of the process.

## Overview

Filecoin Plus (Fil+) not only stores data but also verifies the utility of the stored data, thereby enhancing the utility of Filecoin. DataCap is allocated to clients based on their storage needs and the value their data brings to the Filecoin network. Our team uses a shared multi-signature wallet to act as a DataCap allocator, evaluating and verifying client requests.

## How It Works

This GitHub repository is not a traditional code repository, but rather a structured ledger for processing DataCap requests by client applications. The lifecycle of each application, from request to allocation, is publicly documented here.

### Applying for DataCap

1. **Submit an Issue**: Clients wishing to apply for DataCap must submit a new issue in this repository. The issue should include details about the project requiring DataCap. Basic information includes, but is not limited to:
- Project name and description
- Number of DataCap applications requested
- Number of data replicas and list of SPs.
- KYC applicant information

2. **Fill out the application template**: The issue template will guide clients in submitting the required information for the DataCap application.

### Review and Assignment Process

1. **Preliminary Review**: After the issue is submitted, our assignment team will conduct a preliminary review to ensure all required information has been provided. This includes, but is not limited to: historical performance, data processing tools and processes, KYC completed via email, and inquiring about the SP's retrieval rate.
2. **Discussion and Clarification**: The team may discuss in the issue thread to clarify or obtain further information. Any updates that differ from the application must be clearly indicated and reviewed. Data distribution, retrieval rate, and other aspects will be reviewed before each round of review.
3. **Decision**: The assignment team will make a decision on the DataCap application. If the application is approved, the process will proceed to the assignment phase.
