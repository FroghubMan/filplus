This is a series of recent new open datasets never applied by anybody (aka calling dibs).\r\n\r\nDescription: \r\nThe Cell Painting Gallery is a collection of image datasets created using the Cell Painting assay. The images of cells are captured by microscopy imaging, and reveal the response of various labeled cell components to whatever treatments are tested, which can include genetic perturbations, chemicals or drugs, or different cell types. \r\n\r\ns3://cellpainting-gallery",
