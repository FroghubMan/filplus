    "Brief history of your project and organization": "KyFromAbove acquires aerial imagery and LiDAR during leaf-off conditions in the Commonwealth. The imagery typically ranges from 6-inches to 3-inches in resolution and is available from the kyfromabove Amazon S3 bucket in a [Cloud Optimized GeoTiff](https://www.cogeo.org/) format. All Phase 2 LiDAR data acquired by the program is [USGS Quality Level](https://www.usgs.gov/3d-elevation-program/topographic-data-quality-levels-qls) 2 (QL2), whereas approximately 40% of Phase 1 LiDAR data is considered QL3. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at a 5-foot (Phase 1) or 2-foot (Phase 2) resolution, point cloud data in an LAS format, spot elevations in a geopackage format, and contours in a geopackage format are also available from the kyfromabove Amazon S3 bucket. KyFromAbove LiDAR and imagery data resources are managed in a Kentucky-specific 5000x5000 foot grid (FIPS:1600) (EPSG:3089). Phase 1, Phase2, and Phase 3 imagery acquisitions have been completed. Phase 1 LiDAR acquisitions have been completed and Phase 2 was completed in February of 2024. Phase 3 LiDAR acquistions have been initiated. More details about the program can be found at https://kyfromabove.ky.gov/",

    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We used the Go language to develop a set of tools that automatically download, cut, package data, and place orders. The tool will download the data set file from AWS, package the data set into a car file of the corresponding size by setting parameters such as sector size, and then distribute the car file to each SP through bandwidth and hard disk mail. Then, we use Boost to issue orders offline to let the SP start packaging using the Lotus program.",
