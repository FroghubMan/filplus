    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We used the Go language to develop a set of tools that automatically download, cut, package data, and place orders. The tool will download the data set file from AWS, package the data set into a car file of the corresponding size by setting parameters such as sector size, and then distribute the car file to each SP through bandwidth and hard disk mail. Then, we use Boost to issue orders offline to let the SP start packaging using the Lotus program.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://kyfromabove/ \nTotal Objects: 9387140\nTotal Size: 342.0 TiB\n\n\ns3://kyfromabove/elevation/DEM/Phase1/N047E381_2010_DEM_Phase1_cog.tif\ns3://kyfromabove/elevation/DEM/Phase1/N048E249_2012_DEM_Phase1_cog.tif\ns3://kyfromabove/elevation/DEM/Phase1/N048E283_2012_DEM_Phase1_cog.tif\ns3://kyfromabove/magery/orthos/tile-grids/kyfromabove_phase3_aerial_5k_grid.gpkg\ns3://kyfromabove/imagery/orthos/Phase3/KY_KYAPED_2024_Season1_3IN/N203E092_2024_Season1_3IN_cog.tif\ns3://kyfromabove/imagery/orthos/Phase3/KY_KYAPED_2024_Season1_3IN/N203E084_2024_Season1_3IN_cog.tfw",
